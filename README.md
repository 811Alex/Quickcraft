# Quickcraft
Quickcraft is a very simple fabric client-side mod, that adds one thing: the ability to craft recipes from the recipe book, without having to move your mouse to the crafting table output, to grab the items.
The mod activates if you're holding down ctrl while clicking a recipe. This works both for single items and stacks of items, if you hold ctrl and shift at the same time.
This means that, if you use this mod, it would also be much easier to use an autoclicker to craft things really fast!
